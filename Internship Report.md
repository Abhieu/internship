Internship Report

Position Title: Marketing Intern
Company: Anand Sales Corporation
Duration: 2 Weeks
This internship report presents an overview of my experience as a Marketing Intern at
Anand Sales Corporation from 08/07/2024 to 19/07/2024. As part of the company’s
expansion strategy, a new dry fruit e-commerce platform was in development during my
internship. My role was to contribute to the platform's pre-launch marketing e[orts. The
primary objective of this internship was to gain practical marketing experience by
conducting market research and developing initial marketing strategies for the upcoming
launch.
Anand Sales Corporation is a prominent player in the agricultural export industry,
specializing in the distribution of essential vegetables to international markets. The
company also operates a significant cold storage facility primarily dedicated to
preserving bananas. With a strong profit orientation, Anand Sales Corporation has
established a solid foothold in the sector.
The company's latest venture is an e-commerce platform focused on o]ering a diverse
range of flavoured and salted dry fruits. Targeting the middle-class consumer segment,
the platform aims to capitalize on the availability of high-quality dry fruits at competitive
prices due to the company's proximity to Jammu, a region renowned for its dry fruit
production.
Internship Activities
Competitive Analysis
Competitor Analysis
A comprehensive competitive analysis was conducted on four prominent dry fruit
brands: Ministry of Nuts, Nutraj, Tata Sampann, and Vedaka. These brands cater to the
average Indian family and o]er a wide range of dry fruit products.
• Target Audience: All four competitors primarily target the average Indian family,
emphasizing the health benefits and versatility of dry fruits.
• Product Range: Each brand o]ers a diverse selection of dry fruits, including
almonds, cashews, raisins, and mixed nuts, catering to various consumer
preferences.
• Marketing Strategies: Nutraj heavily relies on Facebook advertising to reach its
target audience. Vedaka, being an Amazon brand, primarily utilizes the Amazon
platform for product promotion. The other two competitors appear to have a mix
of online and o]line marketing strategies.
• Analysis Methodology: A SWOT analysis and price comparison were conducted
for each competitor. The SWOT analysis identified strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats for each brand. The price comparison focused on
product pricing and any ongoing promotional o]ers.
Key Findings:
• Price Competitiveness: There is a relatively narrow price range among the
competitors, indicating a price-sensitive market.
• Product DiEerentiation: While all brands o]er similar products, there is potential
for di]erentiation through unique product o]erings, such as flavoured or organic
options.
• Marketing Channels: Facebook and Amazon appear to be e]ective platforms for
reaching the target audience.
Advertising Campaigns
Due to the early stage of the dry fruit business, no advertising campaigns were launched
during the internship. However, extensive market research and analysis were conducted
to develop a foundation for future campaigns.
Target Audience: The initial focus is on metro cities like Jaipur, Delhi NCR, and
Chandigarh, known for their higher disposable income and health-conscious population.
Campaign Planning: A thorough analysis of the target audience, competitor landscape,
and potential marketing channels will inform the development of e]ective advertising
campaigns.
Key Takeaways:
• The absence of established brand recognition necessitates a strong emphasis on
brand building and awareness creation in initial campaigns.
• A combination of online and o]line marketing channels is likely to be required to
reach the target audience e]ectively.
• Leveraging social media platforms, particularly Facebook, given its success for
competitors, is a promising avenue.
During my internship at Anand Sales Corporation, I had the opportunity to develop a
comprehensive set of marketing skills.
• Market Research and Analysis: Conducting a competitive analysis and market
research for the dry fruit business enhanced my ability to gather and analyze data
to identify market trends, consumer preferences, and competitor strategies.
• Digital Marketing: Exploring digital marketing channels like Facebook advertising
for potential campaign strategies broadened my understanding of online
marketing tactics.
• Strategic Thinking: Developing a foundation for advertising campaigns without
concrete data required strategic thinking to anticipate market needs and develop
e]ective marketing approaches.
• Time Management and Organization: Balancing multiple tasks, such as
competitive analysis and campaign planning, within a short internship period
improved my time management and organizational skills.
• The two-week internship at Anand Sales Corporation provided invaluable insights
into the dynamic world of marketing. My role in supporting the launch of the new
dry fruit e-commerce platform o]ered a unique opportunity to apply theoretical
knowledge to real-world challenges.
• Through competitive analysis and market research, I gained a comprehensive
understanding of the dry fruit industry and identified potential opportunities for
the new platform. While the internship period did not allow for the execution of
full-scale advertising campaigns, the groundwork laid for future marketing e]orts
will be instrumental in the platform's success.
• The experience has significantly enhanced my marketing skills, particularly in
market research, data analysis, and strategic thinking. I am confident that these
skills will serve as a strong foundation for my future career in the marketing field.
Based on my observations during the internship, I would like to o]er the following
recommendations:
• Expand Market Research: Conduct more in-depth market research to identify
specific consumer preferences, purchase behaviour, and consumption patterns
within the target demographic. This information can be used to tailor product
o]erings and marketing messages e]ectively.
• Leverage Social Media: Fully utilize the potential of social media platforms, such
as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, to engage with the target audience, build
brand awareness, and drive tra]ic to the e-commerce platform.
• Influencer Partnerships: Consider collaborating with food and lifestyle
influencers to promote the dry fruit products and reach a wider audience.
• Product Sampling: O]er product samples to potential customers to generate
interest and encourage repeat purchases.
• Loyalty Programs: Develop a loyalty program to reward repeat customers and
foster long-term relationships.
By implementing these recommendations, Anand Sales Corporation can strengthen its
position in the dry fruit market and achieve sustained growth for the new e-commerce
platform.
